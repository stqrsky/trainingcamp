## About "Training Camp"

This is my graduation project from the web devevlopment bootcamp at neuefische Hamburg.

The Trainingcamp App has been developed to make the club life in a sport-bootcamp easier for you. Use the Trainingcamp App to get a quick overview of your member list or plan sparring assignments of athletes anytime and anywhere.
